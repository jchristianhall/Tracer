Identify risk of chronic disease Use Case
"The LHCP has authenticated himself or herself in the iTrust Medical Records system [UC3]. 
Through the Personal Health Records page, an LHCP chooses a chronic disease and a patient. The data in the database is analyzed according to the risk factors for the disease to determine if the patient exhibits a certain risk factor. Currently available risk factors for chronic diseases are defined for Diabetes and Type 1 and Type2 and Heart Disease. When the chosen patient satisfies the preconditions of the chosen chronic disease [E1], the LHCP is provided with a warning message if that patient exhibits three or more risk factors. The message will display the risk factors that the patients exhibit. The event is logged [UC5]. 
• [E1] The LHCP chooses to examine a patient for which the preconditions do not apply (e.g., an adult shouldn't be tested for child diabetes) and the LHCP is prompted that no analysis can occur."
