Alert Users by Email Use Case
"An email alert is sent out to the iTrust user in the event of a changed password [S1], status change in laboratory procedure [S2], accepted scheduled appointment [S3], comprehensive report requested and generated [S4]. Note to students: the iTrust system does NOT currently support actual email sending, only a “fake” email sending facility. All email notifications should be executed through the fake email utility. 
 [S1] The user has successfully changed his/her password [UC3, S2]. An email informing the user of the password change is sent to the user including the MID but not the password.
[S2] The status of a laboratory procedure has been updated [UC26, S3]. The patient is notified with the following information: the LOINC number and the updated status.
[S3] The patient or LHCP has accepted an appointment as scheduled [UC22, S6] and both users are notified of the date, time, length, and comment via email.
[S4] The admin has approved the comprehensive report generation [UC23, S2] or the LHCP generates the report. The patient is notified via email that a comprehensive report was generated, and the MID of the LHCP and the approving Admin are included."
