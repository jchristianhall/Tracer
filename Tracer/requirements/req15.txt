View/Edit Laboratory Procedure Status Use Case
"A patient and HCP are registered users of the iTrust Medical Records system [UC1 and UC2]. The iTrust user has been authenticated in the iTrust Medical Records system [UC3]. 
A patient or personal health representative [S1] or HCP [S2] chooses to view laboratory procedure status; or a HCP chooses to edit a laboratory procedure [S3]. If the HCP is not one of the patient's DLHCP or the UAP associated with one of their DLHCP, a message is sent to the patient and their personal representative [S4]. 
 [S1] The patient can view a list of laboratory procedures and status for (a) their own records and (b) the records for which the user is a personal representative. Only laboratory procedures for which the HCP has allowed viewing access are shown. The list is sorted by date of the last status update, most recent first. The event is logged [UC5, S28].
[S2] The HCP enters a MID [E1] of a patient and confirms their input [E2]. The HCP can view a list of laboratory procedures and results, sorted by the date of the last status update, most recent first. The HCP can choose to sort by date of the last status update or by LOINC code ([UC15 S4], ascending order). If the HCP is the HCP that ordered the laboratory procedure, the HCP can allow or disallow viewing access to the laboratory results and is given the option to edit the office visit in which the laboratory procedure was ordered. The event is logged [UC5, S28].
[S3] The HCP enters a MID [E1] of a patient and confirms their input [E2]. The HCP can view a list of laboratory procedures and can choose to update the status and comments (including results, if applicable) (see Data Format 6.11). The list is sorted by the dates of the last status update. The event is logged [UC5, S28] and an email notification is sent [UC27, S2].
[S4] The patient whose laboratory report was viewed by a LHCP or UAP is notified of the viewing/editing on his or her notification area upon logging into iTrust [patient is provided name of LHCP and/or HCP and the date of access]. This notification remains on the patient's notification screen for a period of 90 days. A fake email is also sent to the patient telling the patient to log onto iTrust to see who has viewed their Emergency Heath Record. Note to students: the iTrust system does NOT currently support actual email sending, only a “fake” email sending facility. All email notifications should be executed through the fake email utility.
 [E1] The HCP types an invalid medical identification number and is prompted to try again.
[E2] The patient chosen is not the desired patient. The HCP does not confirm the selection and is prompted to try again."
